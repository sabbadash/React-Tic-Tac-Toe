# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe, a classic game built with React! This project aims to provide a simple and enjoyable gaming experience for two-player mode.

## 🎮 Features

- **Player Customization:** The game allows players to customize their names.
- **Game Logic**: The game implements the classic rules of Tic Tac Toe, where the first player who gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. The game also detects when there is a draw.
- **Restart Option**: After a game completed, players can restart the game without the need to reload the page or navigate away from the game.
- **Game Log**: A game log, which is located under the game board, displays the sequence of moves made by each player during the game.
  
## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used

- ⚛️ React
- 🟨 JavaScript
- 🎨 CSS
- 🚀 Vite

## 💭 What Improvements Can Be Made?
The project could be improved by implementing a single-player mode with a bot, undo move and visual effects. I think it could be also a good idea to add dark/light mode and customizable board, such as 4x4 or 5x5.
